  # 🔒 Instruct Git to avoid trying to guess defaults for user.email and user.name,
  # and instead retrieve the values only from the configuration.
  # For example, if you have multiple email addresses and would like to use a different one for each repository,
  # then with this configuration option set to true in the global config along with a name,
  # Git will prompt you to set up an email before making new commits in a newly cloned repository.
  # Defaults to false.
